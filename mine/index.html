                    <h4>Recommendation System for an e-commerce Shop(2023)</h4>
                    <p>👩🏻‍💻 I created a recommendation system for a book e-commerce shop by building it from scratch, gathering extensive book data and user ratings from the BookCrossing community, and implementing <strong>collaborative filtering</strong> using <strong>matrix factorization</strong> and a <strong>clustering algorithm</strong>.<p>
                    <h4>Llama 2 chatbot(2023)</h4>
                    <p>🤖 Created a chatbot using <strong>LLM (Llama 2)</strong> by leveraging an API from <strong>Replicate</strong> and deployed it with Streamlit for production.<p>
                    <h4>Lung Cancer Detection(2023)</h4>
                    <p>👨🏾‍⚕️ I presented this project at an <strong>artificial intelligence symposium (IS-AISHSP'23)</strong> in June 2023, showcasing the application of nine machine and deep learning models, such as SVM, CNN, VGG16, and more, along with segmentation, for the detection of lung cancer in patients at different stages using computed tomography scans. Furthermore, I developed a user-friendly web page to integrate the best-performing model for end users.<p>
                    <h4>Automatic monitoring of a distillation machine(2023)</h4>
                    <p>🦾 Utilized machine learning algorithms to oversee a distillation machine, aiming to avert potential failures, detect anomalies, and enhance the overall quality of the end product.<p>
                    <h4>PPE detection(2023)</h4>
                    <p>🧑🏾‍🏭 I employed transfer learning with <strong>YOLOV7</strong> to implement a system for detecting and tracking the usage of personal protective equipment (PPE) among workers in high-risk industries, ensuring adherence to QHSE policies.</p>
                    <h4>Design of a wind turbine(2021)</h4>
                    <p>🧑🏾‍🏭 I carried out the intricate calculations required in the process of designing a wind turbine, and following that, I employed the Solidworks software to craft the design.</p>
